To run the program properly you must start the program from the LoginUI class. Once the program begins, there will be a popup window that request a username and password.
The username and password can be found in the credentialsDB text file (DO NOT DELETE/MOVE THIS TEXT FILE). For example, to be granted access you could enter
"user1" for the username and "1234" as the password. Once access is granted the user can then request trades with
trading brokers, strategies, and multiple coins seperated with commas in between the cryptocoins code name (Enter BTC for bitcoin).

For Strategy-A the coins needed are BTC and ETH (Entered as "BTC,ETH")
For Strategy-B the coins needed are DOGE (Entered as "DOGE")
For Strategy-C the coins needed are ADA (Entered as "ADA")
For Strategy-D the coins needed are CAKE, XRP, and SOL (Entered as "CAKE,XRP,SOL")

For each strategy above the coins can be entered in any order for example, for Strategy-A it can also be "ETH, BTC"
When editing a broker row make sure to click outside the text box before performing a trade to have the row updated for the trade.
If you do not click out of the text box it will still contain its previous value.

Also make sure to not spam the perform trade button to make sure the DataFecther class does not create an error.
